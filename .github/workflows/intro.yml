    - name: What is GitHub Actions?
      run: |
        echo "
          - GitHubs new CI/CD feature for running code on repository activity
          - Currently in limited public Beta
          - Supports Linux, macOS and Windows runtimes
          - So not docker based, but has good docker support
          - I have the feeling that Microsoft is somehow behind this
            - There is at least a lot of TypeScript in the repos
          - Apparently, it is also a handy tool for writing weeklies presentations!
        "
    - name: Is it the same as TravisCI?
      run: |
        echo "
          - In short, Yes!
          - Even the YAML syntax is heavily inspired by Travis
          - But there are some cool things:
            - Reusable and shareable actions (written in Docker or JS)
            - Directly available in GitHub
            - Integrates with all GitHub webhooks, such as issues and releases
              - And enables writing back to GitHub, such as comments and labels
        "
    - name: And GitLab CI and Bitbucket Pipelines?
      run: |
        echo "
          - In short: Yes!
          - But GitHub is the de-facto place for open source repos
          - So I think this will be really popular for open source projects
            - Microsoft probably hopes that as well

    steps:
    - name: Shared actions
      run: |
        echo "
          - The whole thing is in beta, so there aren't that many shared actions yet
            - That will probably change soon
          - Not always clear whether to use a lot of actions or just some shell commands
          - They just changed the syntax for workflows, so all examples are outdated
          - Some cool actions could be:
            - NPM build-test-publush boilerplate on new tags
            - Multiplatform React Native builds and tests
        "
    - name: Package repositories
      run: |
        echo "
          - GitHub also recently introduced package repositories
          - Basically own npm, docker, etc. repos
          - Probably useless for open source projects
          - But quite nice for private things so that you don't need to pay separately for them
          - Couldn't get it to work though with environment GITHUB_TOKEN
        "
    - name: Logs
      run: |
        echo "
          - You can link to specific log lines, which is kind of nice
          - But you can't search the whole logs, without separately opening each job 
        "
    - name: Random things
      run: |
        echo "
          - The workflow syntax seems quite powerful, with some conditionals and expressions
            - Wouldn't be suprised if it was Turing complete
          - Although, unclear how to easily only publish on master branch
          - Haven't looked into writing my own custom actions yet
            - Maybe a separate talk for that?
          - No cache support
            - Might have docker image caching
        "
    - name: Would I use it?
      run: |
        echo "
          - Yeah!
            - Definitely for publishing npm packages
            - Maybe for some client projets as well, after it is out of beta
          - Feels nicer than Travis. (Poor Travis)
          - But I wonder how long this will be free
        "
    - name: Conclusion
      run: |
        echo "
          - Hope they get out of Beta soon, or open to all
          - Hope the community for actions grows soon
          - I guess users are quite excited about this
          - But I wonder how many existing services are getting pissed about Microsoft stepping on their toes
          - Thanks Microsoft
